The *pyDEA* solver was first developed during a summer project in 2009
/ 2010 at the University of Auckland, Department of Engineering Science
by Kane Harton. Development was continued by Harriet Priddey during her
Part IV project at the Department of Engineering Science in 2010. The
code was further modified and enhanced with a GUI by Andrea Raith in
2010 / 2011. Alan Lee, Matt Rouse and Andrea Raith continued work on the
GUI and the underlying DEA solver continued between November 2011 and
February 2012. From 2014, *pyDEA* was re-implemented by Olga
Perederieieva with input from Fariza Fauzi.

Thank you to Paul Rouse for guidance on DEA and help with the revamped
version of *pyDEA*. Also, thank you to Oliver Weide for help with
python.
