Input Data
==========

All input files must be Excel (.xls or .xlsx) or CSV files. The .xls and
.xlsx files can be generated by Excel or OpenOffice Calc, etc and the
.csv can be generated using basic text editors or obtained via data
exporting tools. Data must be in the correct format as outlined below.

Data Format
-----------

The Excel (.xls/.xlsx) or CSV file containing the data for the DEA
analysis must have the following format, see Figure :ref:`fig-input-data`:

-  Input and Output category names are in the first row of the
   spreadsheet. *It is safest to use only words consisting of letters,
   no special characters or numbers. Avoid spaces, especially leading
   spaces*

-  The first column contains DMU names (starting from the second row).

-  Columns that contain empty or negative value cells will be loaded but
   disabled (greyed out).

-  Columns that contain zero entries will be loaded and highlighted. You
   can still run *pyDEA*.

-  Columns that represent categorical variables must be represented by
   integers, see also Section :ref:`sec-categorical`.

Note that *pyDEA* supports multiple worksheets in Excel. You can
choose which worksheet when loading data. Please ensure the worksheets
to be loaded are formatted as described.
